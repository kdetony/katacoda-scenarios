  About the new minikube website
---

As you may have noticed, minikube has a brand new website.

As part of our [2019 roadmap](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/roadmap/), we identified the need for a user-focused website for documentation, and this is it. It's based on the [Hugo Website Framework](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [Docsy Templates for Technical Documentation](https://github.com/google/docsy).

We have more work to do with organizing the documentation and making it more useful, but we hope you are able to enjoy the fruits of our labor. PR's welcome!
